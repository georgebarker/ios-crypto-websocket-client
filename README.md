# iOS Crypto WebSocket Client

A work-in-progress sample iOS app using WebSockets to provide live prices for cryptocurrencies in a list and detailed view.  

## Features to do
- [X] Create list view with test data
- [ ] Create detailed view with test data
- [ ] Hook up to WebSocket API

# Things to improve
- [ ] Format for the correct tick size ($250.5 -> $250.50), requires tick size from the API because there are cryptocurrencies with a ticket size > 2
